#+TITLE: Blorg, a minimalist website engine

* What?

  Blorg is a tiny sinatra app allowing to serve org-mode files.

  It powers the [[http://blorg.hegemonikon.org/][blorg.hegemonikon]] website.

  Blorg converts org-mode files to javascript in the browser
  thanks to the org-js project.

* How to use it?

  You're not supposed to if you're not me.

  If you're me, clone the repository, create a =public/org= folder
  where to put your org-mode files.

  Create a =public/org/index.org= file listing the articles.

  Then launch the sinatra app.
